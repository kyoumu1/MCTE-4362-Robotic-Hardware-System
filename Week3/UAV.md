## History of UAV
- The earliest recorded use of an unmanned aerial vehicle for warfighting occured in July 1849, with a balloon carrier (the precursor to the aircraft carrier) in the first offensive use of air power in naval aviation.
- In 1903, a Spanish engineer Leonardo Torres y Quevedo introduced a radio-based control-system called the _"Telekino"_ at Paris Academy of Science.
- Significant development of drones started in the 1900s, and originally focused on providing practice targets for training military personnel.

- In 1940, the Radioplane Company (started by Denny) and more models emerged during World War II - used both to train anti aircraft gunners and to fly attack-missions.

- After World War II, development of UAV continued such as the American JB-4 (using television/radio-command guidance), the Australian GAF Jindivik and Teledyne Ryan Firebee I of 1951.

- In the 1990s, the U.S. DoD gave a contract to AAI Corporation along with Israeli company Malat. The U.S. Navy bought the AAI Pioneer UAV that AAI and Malat developed jointly.

## Main components of the vehicle

## Robot Design

Unmanned aerial vehicles can classified into different types based on their aerodynamic features.

### Multi-rotor UAV

- Widely used for aerial photography, aerial mapping, and aerial recreational sports.
- Can be classified based on the number of rotors on the UAV: tricopter (three rotors); quadrocopter (four rotors); hexacopter (six rotors); and octocopter (eight rotors).

### Fixed-wing UAV

- These types of UAVs are built similarly to regular airplanes.
- They do not require a lot of energy to stay in the air because they make use of the aerodynamic lift provided by their structure.
- Due to this, they can fly for a longer time compared to the multi-rotor UAVs.

### Single-rotor UAV

- The design similar to helicopters and also the structure of it.
- Usually equipped with a large rotor on top and a small rotor on the tail to control their direction.
